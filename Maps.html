<h6>The colour difference displayed in the map of NSW above shows how many families whose parents speak the English language ONLY. The brighter the colour the more families that live in that region speak the English language only and the darker the less families who live there speak the English language only. 
<br>
<br>By visualising the map on an ariel angle we can visually see that there is a natural divide between the Southern West suburbs and the Northern East suburbs in terms of the colour difference. 
<br> This natural divide is mainly called as the "Latte Line" which divides these two regions in the middle displaying the boundaries between the Down Class and Economic Lines. Based off the map above it is noticeable that most Dependent Children where both parents speak the English languge only are mainly found above the Latte Line and around the Southern West Suburban region. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> The reason why the map above is 3-Dimensional is to show the height differences in terms of the Total Icome of Couple Families with children. The higher the area the more Total Income that families have, and of course the lower the height the less Total Income that families have compare to others. This dataset was chosen as it is comparitively similar in terms of having both parents with children. 
<br> By comparing the colour difference and height difference on the map above it is depicted that most Dependent Children whose Parents speak the English language ONLY have a higher Total Income than those whose parents dont speak the English Language ONLY. This is further displayed in the next Map     </h6>

  The map above is extremely different compared to the first map. This is due to the fact that a different dataset is used. The dataset where the Total Dependent Children whose parents speak another Language and speak English Language very well or well is applied instead of the Total Dependent Children whose parents speak the English Language ONLY dataset.
  <br> Based of the map above it is shown that the brighter the colour the more families who have parents that speak the english language and another language, the darker the less. It is also displayed that the region below Latte Line have a rare amount of Dependent Children that have parents speak the English Language and another , but at other areas around that region there is little to no families whose parents speak more that one language.
